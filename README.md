# Representational Similarity Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of statistical techniques and machine learning methods to address a fundamental question in interpretability research and cognitive neuroscience:  how "alike" are the representations used in different cognitive architectures?  Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) aims to answer this question.

The fundamental finding is that artifacts of statistical modeling can change the headline conclusion used in RSA.  Consequently, careful selection of statistical techniques needs to be employed when using RSA to do interpretability work in machine learning or cognitive neuroscience.
